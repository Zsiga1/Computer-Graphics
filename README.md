# Computer-Graphics
One of my works for the Computer Graphics and Image Processing subject at the university. It's a Ray-tracing program, there are objects made out of gold, silver and glass.

Run: Download the RUN folder from Dropbox, extract the zip, and run the graftest.exe. IMPORTANT: graftest.exe and glut32.dll must be in the same folder. Dropbox: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/3kzt351ripgza7l/AAAW06NbErKLfPJUhSlzoyFca?dl=0

See source code in the graftset.cpp here on github.

Cheers
